##  Introduction

<!-- There are many patterns that can be found for building production-ready software. A good start point could be looking at Chris Richardson's [site](https://microservices.io/patterns/index.html).

This repository was initially built as part of the author's study from Sergey Kargopolov's [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/spring-boot-microservices-cqrs-saga-axon-framework/). The main objective was a build a simple event-driven [microservices](https://microservices.io/patterns/microservices.html) system, as well as the application of patterns like [CQRS](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/cqrs.html), [Event-Sourcing](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/event-sourcing.html), [Saga](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/saga.html), [Database per Service](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/database-per-service.html) and [Domain event](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/domain-event.html).

Next challenges include extending functionalities of this project, adding a nice frontend interface, and explore the patterns above more in depth, as well as impleting other interesting patterns to solve problems that might happen. -->

##  To do

This project is still under development. The next updates will add:

### User

- [   ] Retrieve all Users - ```GET /users```
- [   ] Create a User - ```POST /users```
- [   ] Retrieve one User - ```GET /users/{id}```
- [   ] Delete a User - ```DELETE /users/{id}```

### Posts

- [   ] Retrieve all Posts for a User - ```GET /users/{id}/posts```
- [   ] Create a Post for a User - ```POST /users/{id}/posts```
- [   ] Retrieve details of a post - ```GET /users/{id}/posts/{post_id}```

## ðŸ’» Prerequisites

Before starting, we'll need this:

* Java 11

## :green_book: Richardson Maturity Model

### Level 0
#### Expose SOAP Web Services in REST style
- /getSomething
- /postSomething
- /doSomething

### Level 1
#### Expose resources with proper URI
- /someEntity
- /someEntity
- /someEntity/10

### Level 2
#### LEVEL 1 + HTTP Methods
- GET /someEntity
- POST /someEntity
- GET /someEntity/10
- DELETE /someEntity/10
- PUT /someEntity/10

### Level 3
#### LEVEL 2 + HATEOAS
- data + next possible action

## :+1: Best Practices

### Consumer First

Always think on your consumer.

### Make Best Use of Http
Use correctly Http verbs like `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`.

Provide a proper Response Status 
- `200 Success`
- `404 Not Found`
- `400 Bad Request`
- `201 Created` and so on.

### No secure info in URI
Make sure not to provide secure information on your URIs and resources.

### Use plurals
- Prefer `/users` to `/user`
- Prefer `/users/1` to `/user/1`

### Use nouns for resources
Think about the resource `users` and what can be done with it: create, delete, fetch, update. 

There will be cases where you'll need to do an action, like `search` and you might come up with something like
- /search
- PUT /user/{id}/post
- DELETE /user/{id}/post

Define a consistent approach for your API.

<!-- ## ðŸš€ Getting started

In order to start up the project, you'll need an instance of [Axon Server](https://axoniq.io/product-overview/axon-server)

Axon Server: run this command inside `axon-server` folder.
```
sh ./run-axon.sh
```
In case that is any doubt on running axon server in a docker container, there's an axon's blog post that can be helpful: https://axoniq.io/blog-overview/running-axon-server-in-docker


Start running first `discovery-server`. Then run `orders-service`, `payments-service`, `products-service` and `users-service`. The last one will be `api-gateway`. -->


<!-- ## â˜• Working with the API

### products-service

#### Creating a product

`POST /products-service/products`

     curl -i -H 'Accept: application/json' \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      -d '{ "title": "Foo", "price": 10, "quantity": 2 }' \
      http://localhost:8082/products-service/products

### Response

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Type: application/json

    11dee306-0103-4c33-97f9-76b43112f096

### orders-service

#### Placing an order for a product

`POST /orders-service/orders`

     curl -i -H 'Accept: application/json' \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      -d '{
            "productId": "11dee306-0103-4c33-97f9-76b43112f096",
